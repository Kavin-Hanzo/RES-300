# Deep Learning Framework for Methane Plume Segmentation using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery

This repository implements a scalable deep learning framework for detecting methane emissions using dual-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery and synthetic training data. It is based on a transformer-driven architecture (SwinUNETR) trained entirely on physically simulated methane plumes.

ðŸ“˜ Overview
Methane (CHâ‚„) is a potent greenhouse gas and a critical target for emission monitoring. This repository contains the full implementation of a framework that:

- Preprocesses Sentinel-2 imagery into paired temporal tiles

- Generates synthetic methane plumes using a Gaussian dispersion model

- Applies Beerâ€“Lambert law to embed spectral absorption into Band 12

- Trains a SwinUNETR transformer-based segmentation model

- Supports evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., Carbon Mapper)

`Use quick_test.py to get the output`
 - saves the output plots in `segmentation_results`
